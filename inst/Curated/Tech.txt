	PMID28974764	Producer	Magnetic bead assay for mechanical stimulation of endothelial cells	Assay	The assay mechanically stimulates endothelial cells using thrombin-coated magnetic beads that are manipulated by rare earth magnets. It can more specifically study the effects of mechanical stimulation compared to using soluble signaling factors. Moreover, somewhat variable static and dynamic stimulation studies can be implemented by adjusting the placement and rotation speeds of the magnets.

	PMID29434325	Producer	CellCycleTRACER (mass cytometry assay method for deconfounding cell-cycle and cell-volume effects)	Assay	CellCycleTRACER is a combined experimental and computational method to account for the often confounded factors cell cycle and cell volume in mass cytometry data. Resolving cell heterogeneity caused by either cell-cycle state or cell volume in single-cell transcriptomic data has relied on statistical analysis using known cell-cycle genes. For mass cytometry, there is so far a more limited selection of available informative markers related to cell cycle and volume. As an assay method, CellCycleTRACER exploits four cell-cycle markers recently identified by Behbehani et al. 2012 (phosphorylated histone H3, phosphorylated retinoblastoma,  cyclin B1, and 5-Iodo-2′-deoxyuridine) to distinguish cell populations in different cell-cycle states. For measuring cell volume, CellCycleTRACER uses the ruthenium complex ASCQ_Ru. CellCycleTRACER may be particularly important when heterogeneous cell populations with deregulated cellular processes, as typically found in tumors, are analyzed.		OBI_0001977						
	PMID29434325	Producer	CellCycleTRACER (algorithm for cell-cycle and cell-volume correction in mass cytometry data)	CodePipeline	CellCycleTRACER is a supervised machine-learning algorithm that classifies and sorts single-cell mass cytometry data according to their cell cycle, which allows us to correct for cell-cycle-state and cell-volume heterogeneity.

	PMID29605184 	Producer	Bead-based compensation of signal spillover in suspension and imaging mass cytometry	Assay	This novel bead-based compensation approach estimates and corrects for interference between mass cytometry channels. The method simplifies development of new antibody panels, increases flexibility for antibody-metal pairing, opens the way to using less pure isotopes, and improves overall data quality. Based on the same idea in flow cytometry, controls stained with single antibodies are used to estimate signal crosstalk. In application, control samples stained with individual antibodies can be generated by staining polystyrene antibody-capture beads.		OBI_0001977 	ERO_0001718|ERO_0001309					
	PMID29605184 	Producer	CATALYST R/Bioconductor package	CodePipeline	The R/Bioconductor package implements several data processing steps for the bead-based compensation method to semi-automate spillover correction in mass cytometry (see details in Assay). First, the FCS file containing data on the bead sample is deconvoluted to identify the individual single-antibody-positive bead populations using a new R implementation of the debarcoding algorithm from Zunder et al. 2015. Then the spillover matrix is calculated based on the spillover observed for single-stained populations. Finally, the calculated compensation matrix is applied to the bead and cell samples to remove interfering signals. There is also a Shiny web application to provide an even friendlier user interface to the data processing pipeline.			OBI_0000666|ERO_0001309					https://bioconductor.org/packages/CATALYST

	PMID29941660	Producer	Automated sample transfer to nanodroplets for spatially resolved proteome mapping of laser capture microdissected tissue	DeviceEquipment 	An integrated and automated method that seamlessly couples laser capture microdissection (LCM) with nanoPOTS (Nanodroplet Processing in One pot for Trace Samples). The workflow is enabled by prepopulating nanowells with DMSO, which serves as a sacrificial capture liquid for microdissected tissues. The DMSO droplets efficiently collect laser-pressure catapulted LCM tissues as small as 20 μm in diameter with success rates >87%. Tissue treatment with DMSO can significantly improve proteome coverage, likely due to its ability to dissolve lipids from tissue and enhance protein extraction efficiency. The LCM-nanoPOTS platform was able to identify 180, 695, and 1827 protein groups on average from 12-μm-thick rat brain cortex tissue sections having diameters of 50, 100, and 200 μm, respectively.

	PMID29925683 	Producer	Using hepatocyte-specific methylation markers in cell-free circulating DNA for monitoring liver damage	Assay	The method detects acute hepatocyte death based on quantification of circulating, cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments carrying hepatocyte-specific methylation patterns (3 genomic loci that are unmethylated specifically in hepatocytes). It can be used for detection after liver transplantation, during acute rejection of an established liver transplant, and also in healthy individuals after partial hepatectomy. Measurements correlate with traditional measurements of liver enzymes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Measurements of hepatocyte-derived cfDNA can provide specific and sensitive information on hepatocyte death, for monitoring human liver dynamics, disease, and toxicity.

	PMID30271983	Producer	cPRISM-SRM (carrier-assisted high-pressure, high-resolution separations with intelligent selection and multiplexing coupled to selected reaction monitoring)	Assay	"cPRISM-SRM is an extension of MS-based proteomic analysis with the key feature of being able to characterize low numbers of mammalian cells. Compared to current targeted MS methods,  CPRISM-SRM requires 3–4 orders of magnitude lower cell numbers. The method capitalizes on using ""carrier protein"" to assist processing of low numbers of cells with minimal loss, high-resolution PRISM separation for target peptide enrichment, and sensitive-targeted MS (SRM) for protein quantification. cPRISM-SRM has sufficient sensitivity to quantify proteins expressed at ≥200,000 copies per cell at the single-cell level and ≥3000 copies per cell in 100 mammalian cells. With further improvement cPRISM-SRM has the potential to move toward targeted MS-based single-cell proteomics."		OBI_0000470				CL_0002327

	PMID30210768	Producer	Nanowell-mediated 2D liquid chromatography separations for in-depth proteome profiling	Assay	The nanowell platform reduces the amount of protein required for multidimensional peptide separation, increasing the possible depth of coverage. Peptides are first separated using high-pH LC and the effluent is concatenated into 4 or 12 nanowells. The contents of each nanowell are reconstituted in LC buffer and collected for subsequent separation and analysis by low-pH nanoLC-MS/MS. The nanowell platform minimizes peptide losses to surfaces in offline 2D LC fractionation, enabling >5800 proteins to be confidently identified from just 50 ng of cell digest. As proof of principle, the platform was combined with a recently developed nanowell-based sample preparation workflow to do deep proteome profiling of >6000 protein groups from small populations of cells, including ∼650 HeLa cells and 10 single human pancreatic islet thin sections (∼1000 cells) from a pre-symptomatic type 1 diabetic donor.

	PMID30224090	Producer	3-D physiomimetic extracellular matrix hydrogels for islet culture	DeviceEquipment	This islet-on-a-chip platform’s main key feature is extending the cell survival and culture time through minimizing disruption of islet-matrix interactions following isolation. Protocols for decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels were tested and refined with both rodent and human islets.

	PMID30298069	Producer	ImmuneDB, a novel tool for the analysis, storage, and dissemination of immune repertoire sequencing data	Software	ImmuneDB is a system for storing and analyzing high-throughput immune receptor sequencing data. Unlike most existing tools, which utilize flat-files, ImmuneDB stores data in a well-structured MySQL database, enabling efficient data queries. It can take raw sequencing data as input and annotate receptor gene usage, infer clonotypes, aggregate results, and run common downstream analyses such as calculating selection pressure and constructing clonal lineages. Alternatively, pre-annotated data can be imported and analyzed data can be exported in a variety of common Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) file formats. ImmuneDB results were comparable to another pipeline, MiXCR, while providing the additional benefits of integrating other common tools and storing data in a database. ImmuneDB is freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/arosenfeld/immunedb, on PyPi at https://pypi.org/project/ImmuneDB, and a Docker container is provided at https://hub.docker.com/r/arosenfeld/immunedb.

	PMID30644734	Producer	Electrochemical aptamer-based sensor for real-time monitoring of insulin	DeviceEquipment	The electrochemical, aptamer-based (E-AB) sensor for the real-time monitoring of insulin utilizes a redox label-modified guanine-rich aptamer which folds into a G-quadruplex for specific recognition of insulin. To develop a reproducible E-AB sensor employing insulin aptamer probes for the detection of insulin, 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) pretreatment is crucial as it disrupts interstrand G-quartets. After sensor pretreatment with 10% SDS, a more uniform sensor response is obtained. Upon introduction of the insulin target, binding-induced steric hindrance quantitatively reduces the efficiency of electron transfer of a distal-end redox label leading to the rapid signal change within ∼60 s. Testing demonstrates that the E-AB insulin exhibits a limit of detection of 20 nM and can be used to discriminate against both glucagon and somatostatin in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, typically used in perfusion experiments. These results demonstrate that this assay has potential for rapid, specific, and quantitative analysis of insulin.		ERO_0000957

	PMID30571786	Producer	Microfluidic device to attain high spatial and temporal control of oxygen	DeviceEquipment 	The microfluidic device can control both the spatial and temporal variations in oxygen tensions to better replicate in vivo biology. The device consists of three parallel connected tissue chambers and an oxygen scavenger channel placed adjacent to these tissue chambers. Experimentally measured oxygen maps were constructed using phosphorescent lifetime imaging microscopy and compared with values from a computational model. For testing, it was coupled with a 3D sprouting angiogenesis assay. The simple design provides consistent control of spatial and temporal oxygen gradients in the tissue microenvironment and can be used to investigate important oxygen-dependent biological processes.

	PMID30843680	Producer 	Boosting to Amplify Signal with Isobaric Labeling (BASIL) Strategy for comprehensive quantitative phosphoproteomic characterization of small populations of cells	Assay 	"Phosphoproteomic analysis of small cell populations is a challenge due to insufficient MS signal intensity, and the BASIL innovation of using isobaric labeling to ""boost"" a sample (e.g., a biological sample mimicking the study samples but available in a much larger quantity) in multiplexed analysis enables sensitive and comprehensive quantitative phosphoproteomic measurements with <100 000 cells. The BASIL strategy increases the overall number of quantifiable phosphorylation sites more than 4-fold. Good reproducibility in quantification was demonstrated with a median CV of 15.3% and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.95 from biological replicates. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrated the ability of BASIL to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia cells based on the phosphoproteome data. Moreover, in a pilot application, this strategy enabled quantitative analysis of over 20 000 phosphorylation sites from human pancreatic islets treated with interleukin-1β and interferon-γ. Together, this signal boosting strategy provides an attractive solution for comprehensive and quantitative phosphoproteome profiling of relatively small populations of cells where traditional phosphoproteomic workflows lack sufficient sensitivity."
