Transcription profiling of Foxa2 knock-outs in mice to better define the role of this gene in glucose homeostasis	15314688	Study to further characterize the genetic and functional consequence of the beta cell-specific ablation of Foxa2 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 beta, HNF-3b) in mice to better define the role of this gene in glucose homeostasis. The study involved 8 two-channel assays on UPenn Mouse PancChip 4.0, each consisting of a competitive mutant vs control hybridization. 4 control and 4 Foxa2loxP/loxP;Ins.CRE RNA samples were hybridized to the array using a dye-swap design. (The results from one of these assays had to be discarded from the analyses, so 7 assays were used.)

Transcription profiling of cultured normal human islet tissue, islets treated with interferon alpha 2 beta, islet-depleted exocrine pancreas, pancreas, liver and kidney tissue	15231694	The purpose of this study was to identify mRNA transcripts encoding tissue restricted cell surface proteins on human islet tissue that, in turn, might serve as markers for determination of healthy, transplanted and/or diseased islet cell mass.  Using oligonucleotide microarrays and clinical grade human islets, we obtained the gene expression profiles of cultured normal islet tissue and compared them to profiles of islets treated with interferon alpha 2 beta, islet-depleted exocrine pancreas, pooled whole pancreas, pooled liver and pooled kidney tissue.  Data set filtering and comparisons of gene expression patterns revealed a small set of genes corresponding to transmembrane or membrane associated proteins with limited tissue distributions (present in Islets of Langerhans and, often, central or peripheral nervous system tissues, but absent from exocrine pancreas, liver, kidney and other tissues) with possible utility as novel islet markers.  Under the influence of IFN alpha, some of these transcripts show differential expression as confirmed by real time PCR.  In addition, we found significant differential expression of two sets of transcripts expressed in islets but with broad tissue distributions, non classical MHC class I b  (HLA-G and F) and MHC Class II locus (e.g. HLA-DR alpha and HLA-DQ alpha and beta).

Transcription profiling of wild type and foxA1 null mice	17185391	The aim of this experiment was to use microarray analysis to examine the phenotype of the foxA1 (HNF3alpha) null mouse. foxA1 has a central role in the regulatory control of islet genes essential for glucose homeostasis in vivo.  Previous studies have shown that the foxA1 null mouse demonstrates severe postnatal growth retardation followed by death between P2 and P12. These mutant mice are hypoglycemic despite unchanged expression of foxA1 target genes involved in hepatic gluconeogenesis. foxA1 is known to bind to and transactivate the proglucagon gene promoter and mice null for this gene have a 70% reduction in pancreatic proglucagon gene expression and plasma glucagon levels are reduced markedly.  Marco Vatamaniuk from Klaus Kaestner Lab extracted RNA from isolated islets.  Three biological replicates were provided for both the WT and Null.

Transcription profiling of rat insulinoma (INS-1 derived) cell lines that vary in their glucose responsiveness	17185391	The aim of this study was to identify the gene expression changes associated with glucose responsiveness in Rat INS-1 derived cell lines.  RNA was prepared from cell lines which were shown to be highly glucose responsive and also lines which were shown to be poorly glucose responsive.  Dr. Chris Newgard's lab quantified the RNA and sent it frozen in water. 3 biological replicates per condition were sent for the following conditions: (i) 832/13 and 833/15, robust glucose responsiveness; (ii)832/1 and 832/2 showed poor glucose responsiveness.

Transcription profiling of rat insulinoma (INS-1 derived) cells grown in lipid culture	17185391	This experiment was designed to study the effects of lipid culture on INS-1 derived glucose-responsive 832/13 cells.  After 48-hr culture with lipids, a dramatic decrease in glucose-responsiveness is observed.  In order to detect some earlier changes, RNA was also collected at earlier time points (12 hr and 24 hr).   To compensate for any changes associated with cell density, control cells (1%BSA culture) were included for each time point.  RNA was prepared from INS-1 cells in Dr. Chris Newgard's lab, quantified and sent frozen in water. Six biological replicates were sent for the following conditions: (i) 1%BSA (12, 24, and 48 hours) (ii) 1mM-Oleate/Palmitate (12, 24, and 48 hours).

Transcription profiling of cells from four developmental stages of human endocrine pancreas to define genetic pathways that regulate endocrine pancreatic development	14660441	To define genetic pathways that regulate development of the endocrine pancreas, we generated transcriptional profiles of enriched cells isolated from four biologically significant stages of endocrine pancreas development: endoderm before pancreas specification, early pancreatic progenitor cells, endocrine progenitor cells and adult islets of Langerhans. These analyses implicate new signaling pathways in endocrine pancreas development, and identified sets of known and novel genes that are temporally regulated, as well as genes that spatially define developing endocrine cells from their neighbors. The differential expression of several genes from each time point was verified by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. Moreover, we present preliminary functional evidence suggesting that one transcription factor encoding gene (Myt1), which was identified in our screen, is expressed in endocrine progenitors and may regulate alpha, beta and delta cell development. In addition to identifying new genes that regulate endocrine cell fate, this global gene expression analysis has uncovered informative biological trends that occur during endocrine differentiation.

Transcription profiling of mouse pancreatic duct cell lines infected with Ngn3-expressing adenovirus	15340143	We have developed an in vitro model of Ngn3-dependent differentiation by infecting pancreatic duct cell lines with an Ngn3-expressing adenovirus. We used glass microarrays containing 18,000 mouse cDNAs and compared gene expression patterns in mPAC L20 cells infected with either AdCMV-gal (control) or AdCMV-ngn3. All comparisons were performed 48 h after viral infection, meaning that genes differentially expressed in Ngn3-expressing mPAC cells could include genes whose expression was directly or indirectly controlled by Ngn3.

Transcription profiling of mouse islet growth after partial pancreatectomy and exendin-4 Treatment	16410542	Diabetes mellitus results from an inadequately functioning beta-cell mass.  In the adult pancreas, beta-cell mass is dynamic, increasing to meet metabolic demands and decreasing with metabolic or injury insults. Exendin-4 (Ex-4) is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that augments beta-cell mass by increasing beta-cell neogenesis and proliferation and by reducing apoptosis. We utilized a cDNA microarray approach to identify genes that are differentially regulated during islet growth after Ex-4 treatment or a partial pancreatectomy (Ppx). Mice underwent 50% Ppx or sham operation and received Ex-4 or vehicle every 24 hours. cDNA prepared from total pancreatic RNA isolated at 12, 24 and 48 hrs after surgery was hybridized to the PancChip 4.0 microarray.

Transcription profiling of rat pancreatic beta-cells in response to double stranded RNA and IFNgamma exposure	14600816	Viral infections and local production of IFNgamma might contribute to beta-cell dysfunction/death in Type 1 diabetes. Double stranded RNA accumulates in the cytosol of viral-infected cells, and exposure of purified rat beta cells to dsRNA (polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, PIC) in combination with IFNgamma results in beta-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.  To elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in PIC + IFNgamma-effects, we determined the global profile of genes modified by these agents in primary rat beta cells.  FACS-purified rat beta cells were cultured for 6 or 24 h in control condition or with IFNgamma, PIC or a combination of both agents. The gene expression profile was analyzed in duplicate with the Affymetrix RG U34A microarray.

Transcription profiling of rat insulinoma-beta (INS-1E) cells exposed to the cytokines IL-1-beta and IFN-gamma for six different lengths of time and with or without the inducible NO synthase blocker NMA	14578289	Locally released cytokines contribute to beta cell dysfunction and apoptosis in Type 1 diabetes. In vitro exposure of insulin producing INS-1E cells to the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta + interferon (IFN) gamma leads to a significant increase in apoptosis.  To characterize the genetic networks implicated in beta cell dysfunction and apoptosis and its dependence on nitric oxide (NO) production, we performed a time course analysis using the Affymetrix RG U34A microarry.  INS-1E cells were exposed in duplicate to IL-1beta + IFN-gamma for six different time points (1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h) with or without the inducible NO synthase blocker.	transcription profiling by RT-PCR assay	transcription profiling by array	OBI_0001361	Transcriptomics		Request		pancreatic A cell		mouse			3		
Transcription profiling of rat pancreatic beta-cells in response to cytokine exposure and NF-kappa B activation blocking	11687580	Type 1 diabetes mellitus results from an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. Based on findings suggesting NF-kappa B plays a role in beta cell apoptosis, we blocked NF-kappa B activation in cytokine-exposed FACS sorted beta cells by a recombinant adenovirus (AdI kappa B((SA)2)) containing an inhibitor of NF kappa B alpha (I kappa Bac) super-repressor (S32A/S36A).  The expression profile was then analyzed with the Affymetrix RG U34a microarray.	transcription profiling by RT-PCR assay	transcription profiling by array	OBI_0001361	Transcriptomics		Request		multi fate stem cell		mouse			3		
Transcription profiling of rat pancreatic beta-cells in response to INF gamma and/or IL-1 beta treatment for 6 or 24 hours	11334433	Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease resulting from the selective destruction of insulin-producing beta-cells. Beta cell culture for 6-9 days in the presence of IL-1 beta and interferon (INF) gamma leads to apoptosis.  Primary rat beta-cells were FACS purified and exposed for 6 or 24 h to control condition, IL-1 beta + INF gamma, or IL-1 beta alone (24 h only).

Transcription profiling of wild type and Foxa2 knock out mouse mature beta cells	17908556	The winged helix transcription factor Foxa2 regulates Pdx1 gene expression and fetal endocrine pancreas development. We show here by inducible gene ablation that Foxa2 inactivation in mature beta-cells induces hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in Foxa2loxP/loxP, Pdx1-CreERT2 adult mice. Mutant beta-cells exhibited a markedly increased pool of docked insulin granules, some of which were engaged in sequential or compound exocytosis, consistent with an increased first phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Expression of multiple genes involved in vesicular trafficking, membrane targeting and fuel-secretion pathways is dependent on Foxa2. In addition, impaired cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations and elevated intracellular cAMP production accompanied this secretory defect, and were likely contributors to the sensitization of the exocytotic machinery. Thus, in the absence of Foxa2, alterations in intracellular second messenger signaling redistribute the insulin granules into the readily releasable pool. We conclude that Foxa2 is required both for the fetal pancreas development and for the function of mature beta-cells.	immunoSEQ	transcription profiling by array	OBI_0001247	Genomics		Request		islet of Langerhans		mouse			3		
Chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcription of mouse liver in the presence or absence of exogenous glucocorticoid to identify direct targets of the glucocorticoid receptor	16110340	The purpose of this study was to identify direct targets of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) using an orthogonal analysis.  An expression study of mouse livers in the presence or absence of exogenous glucocorticoid complemented a genome-wide location analysis on chromatin from the same livers.  These were hybridized to the BCBC Mouse PancChip 5.0 and the Mouse PromoterChip BCBC-3.0 respectively.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation of wild type and Foxa2 knock-out mouse liver using anti-HNF6 anitbodies to test whether Foxa2 inhibits HNF6-mediated transcription in the liver	16055718	The aim of this study was to test, in vivo, if Foxa2 inhibits HNF6-mediated transcription in the liver.  We utilized hepatocyte-specific gene ablation of Foxa2 and the Mouse PromoterChip BCBC 3.0 and Mouse PancChip 5.0 cDNA microarrays to investigate HNF6 binding to its target promoters in vivo in the presence or absence of Foxa2.  For the mouse promoter microarray analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation using anti-HNF6 antibodies was performed on chromatin isolated from Foxa2loxP/loxP Alfp.Cre and control mouse livers.  Along with sheared genomic DNA (common reference), the immunoprecipitated DNA was amplified, labeled and hybridized to the Mouse PromoterChip BCBC 3.0.  For microarray analysis of gene expression, liver RNAs were isolated from three Foxa2loxP/loxP Alfp.Cre and three control mice. RNAs were reverse transcribed, labeled, and hybridized to the Mouse PancChip 5.0.  Overall, our studies demonstrate that HNF6 binds to and regulates its target promoters in vivo in the presence and absence of Foxa2 and that the expression levels of HNF6 targets are not influenced by Foxa2.	cytometry time of flight assay	ChIP-chip by array	OBI_0002115	Cellomics		Alternate accession			MDA-MB-231|HEK293T|THP-1	human			2	https://community.cytobank.org/cytobank/projects/1129	
Transcription profiling of wild type and C/EBPbeta deficient mice during a partial hepatectomy time series to identify transcriptional targets of C/EBPbeta	15317935	The aim of this experiment was to use microarray analysis to compare the response of wild type (WT) and C/EBPbeta deficient (KO) mice during a partial hepatectomy time course in hopes of identifying transcriptional targets of C/EBPbeta. In addition, the WT time course alone was examined to analyze mammalian cellular proliferation in vivo.  In the partial hepatectomy model, quiescent hepatocytes reenter the cell cycle and progress in a synchronous fashion.  This allows for the elucidation of regulatory networks operative in mammalian cell cycle.

Transcription profiling of mouse pancreatic islets on day 14.5 of pregnancy	19574445	The inability of the beta-cell to meet the demand for insulin brought about by insulin resistance leads to type 2 diabetes. In adults, beta-cell replication is one of the mechanisms thought to cause the expansion of beta-cell mass. Efforts to treat diabetes require knowledge of the pathways that drive facultative beta-cell proliferation in vivo. A robust physiological stimulus of beta-cell expansion is pregnancy, and identifying the mechanisms underlying this stimulus may provide therapeutic leads for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The peak in beta-cell proliferation during pregnancy occurs on day 14.5 of gestation in mice. Using advanced genomic approaches, we globally characterize the gene expression signature of pancreatic islets on day 14.5 of gestation during pregnancy. We identify a total of 1,907 genes as differentially expressed in the islet during pregnancy. We demonstrate that the islet's ability to compensate for relative insulin deficiency during metabolic stress is associated with the induction of both proliferative and survival pathways. A comparison of the genes induced in three different models of islet expansion suggests that diverse mechanisms can be recruited to expand islet mass. The identification of many novel genes involved in islet expansion during pregnancy provides an important resource for diabetes researchers to further investigate how these factors contribute to the maintenance of not only islet mass, but ultimately beta-cell mass.

ChIP-seq and RNA-seq of coding RNA of the progression of human embryonic stem cells to beta cells to characterize the epigenetic programs that underlie pancreas differentiation	23318056	To characterize the epigenetic programs that underlie pancreas differentiation, we have generated genome-scale maps of H3K4me and H3K27me3 patterns by ChIP-seq and determined expression profiles by RNA-seq from undifferentiated human ESCs, four intermediate differentiated stages (definitive endoderm, primitive gut tube, posterior foregut, and pancreatic endoderm), and in vitro-differentiated polyhormonal cells. Antibodies against CD142 and CD200 were used to select for targeted pancreatic and endocrine populations at the end of the culture. Cells at the end of culture were implanted into mice for further differentiation into mature insulin-producing beta-cells and compared to sorted polyhormonal cells by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis. For the experimental factor values the time points are along a differentiation protocol from stem cells to tissue. Values in the CD antibody column refer to antibodies used for cell sorting. In this column 'not applicable' refers to samples that were not sorted.  'none' refers to samples that were sorted, but did not bind to either of the two antibodies, CD200 and CD142.

Cytotoxicity Study of Rat INS1 cell lines		Cytokines IL-1 and IFN-gamma have been shown to be the primary effectors of beta-cell destruction during the immune response. The aim of this study was to identify the gene expression changes that are associated with resistance of beta cells to cytokines. INS-1 rat insulinoma cells were grown in increasing doses of cytokines until a resistance phenotype had developed. RNA was prepared from these cytokine resistant sublines as well as the original, cytokine-sensitive parental INS-1 cells in Dr. Chris Newgard's lab, quantified and sent frozen in water. 3-7 biological replicates per condition were sent for the following three conditions: (i) 834/40, Cytokine-sensitive (CS), (ii) 833/15 and 833/117, Cytokine resistant grown in the absence of cytokines (CRu), (iii) 833/15C and 833/117C: Cytokine Resistant Grown in the Presence of Cytokines (CRt).

Affymetrix MOE430v2 vs Mouse PancChip 5.0 comparison		Comparison of two microarray platforms: the Mouse PancChip 5.0 and the Affymetrix GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array. The aim of this experiment was to determine the ability to identify differentially expressed genes in islet and pancreas RNA, and the sensitivity of the two platforms, using the same source material in a carefully controlled manner. RNA was extracted from adult mouse pancreas (n=5) and highly purified islet samples (n = 5). All samples were amplified once. 5 biological replicates (islets vs. pancreas) in a dye swap experimental design were hybridized to the PancChip. 3 biological replicates, using the same amplified RNA hybridized to the PancChip, of both the pancreas and islet samples were also hybridized to the GeneChip. All data were normalized using appropriate methods and differential expression between islet and pancreas was determined using PaGE with a 10% FDR. The study revealed that the PancChip is a highly cost effective alternative to the Affymetrix 430-2, that the PancChip is up to 60% more sensitive than the Affymetrix 430-2 GeneChip and that 80% (7,000) of the probe sets on the PancChip show expression in either Islets or Pancreas, while only 25% (6,800) show expression on the Affymetrix GeneChip.	immunoSEQ	transcription profiling by array	OBI_0001247	Genomics		Request		alpha-beta T cell		human			3

Single-cell RNA-seq data of mammary gland epithelial cells from different gestational stages to detect and remove barcode swapping		Barcode swapping results in the mislabeling of sequencing reads between multiplexed samples on the new patterned flow cell Illumina sequencing machines. This may compromise the validity of numerous genomic assays, especially for single-cell studies where many samples are routinely multiplexed together. The severity and consequences of barcode swapping for single-cell transcriptomic studies remain poorly understood. We have used two statistical approaches to robustly quantify the fraction of swapped reads in each of two plate-based single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. We found that approximately 2.5% of reads were mislabeled between samples on the HiSeq 4000 machine, which is lower than previous reports. We observed no correlation between the swapped fraction of reads and the concentration of free barcode across plates. Further- more, we have demonstrated that barcode swapping may generate complex but artefactual cell libraries in droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing studies. To eliminate these artefacts, we have developed an algorithm to exclude individual molecules that have swapped between samples in 10X Genomics experiments, exploiting the combinatorial complexity present in the data. This permits the continued use of cutting-edge sequencing machines for droplet-based experiments while avoiding the confounding effects of barcode swapping.  This data repository contains the sequencing files associated with the droplet based scRNA-seq dataset in Griffiths et al. (2018). The data presented here should purely used for technical analysis, the biological motivation is nonetheless briefly described in the following: The mammary gland is a unique organ as it undergoes most of its development during puberty and adulthood. Characterising the hierarchy of the various mammary epithelial cells and how they are regulated in response to gestation, lactation and involution is important for understanding how breast cancer develops. Recent studies have used numerous markers to enrich, isolate and characterise the different epithelial cell compartments within the adult mammary gland. However, in all of these studies only a handful of markers were used to define and trace cell populations. Therefore, there is a need for an unbiased and comprehensive description of mammary epithelial cells within the gland at different developmental stages. To this end we used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to determine the gene expression profile of individual mammary epithelial cells across four adult developmental stages; nulliparous, mid gestation, lactation and post weaning (full natural involution).
